Lab Exercise 12
---------------

1. So far, we used the entity model to pass around in REST.
   We had to update our entity classes, to work with
   JSON/JAXB serialization/deserialization

   Better approach is to use Resource representation classes.

2. Add new package for representations, e.g. chirp.service.representations

3. Add new representation classes, e.g.

     UserRepresentation
       - string fields for username, realname
       - default constructor
       - constructor passing a user
       - getters for fields
       - setters for fields

     PostRepresentation
       - string fields for timestamp, content
       - default constructor
       - constructor passing a post
       - getters for fields
       - setters for fields

4. Update UserResource to return UserRepresentation objects and their collections
     
5. Update PostResource to return PostRepresentation objects and their collections

6. Update UserRepresentation and PostRepresentation to include JAXB bindings, so we can serialize/deserialize to and from XML.

7. Add summary representations:
       - UserRepresentation - return only usernames, not realnames (make it null)
       - PostRepresentation - return only timestamps, not content (make it null)

8. Make sure your tests work.
