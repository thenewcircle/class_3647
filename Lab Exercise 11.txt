Lab Exercise 11
---------------

1. So far we have completed the following use cases:

     + Create a user   (done)
     + Get a user      (done)
     + Get users       (done)
     + Create a post for selected user (done)

   Let's create the following use cases:
 
     - Get all posts (sorted by timestamp)
     - Get all posts by user (sorted by timestamp)

   Optionally, we could include the following usecases
     - Delete user
     - Update user 
  
2. Make sure you have the mappers for all runtime exceptions we throw, e.g.

     - DuplicateEntityException
     - NoSuchEntityException
