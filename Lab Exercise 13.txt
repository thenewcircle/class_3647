Lab Exercise 13
---------------

1. We got the representation classes for User and Post entities.
   Now let's add representation classes for collections of users and posts.

2. Add new classes to chirp.services.representations

     UserCollectionRepresentation
       - field users - Collection<UserRepresentation> 
       - default constructor
       - constructor passing in Collection<UserRepresentation>
       - setters and getters for users

     PostCollectionRepresentation
       - field posts - Collection<PostRepresentation> 
       - default constructor
       - constructor passing in Collection<PostRepresentation>
       - setters and getters for posts
   
3. Add to existing getter tests (in testcases UserResourceTest and PostResourceTest)
   Check for content returning back.

   Use response.readEntity(UserRepresentation.class) to read UserRepresentation
   Use response.readEntity(UserCollectionRepresentation.class) to read UserCollectionRepresentation
   Use response.readEntity(PostRepresentation.class) to read PostRepresentation
   Use response.readEntity(PostCollectionRepresentation.class) to read PostCollectionRepresentation
