Lab Exercise 6
--------------

1. Now that we created a user, let's map some exceptions.
   Observe what type of exceptions are defined in the model.
   
2. Create a new test case that handles the case when you have duplicate entities.
   It should return FORBIDDEN response value.
   
3. Let's update our server to include additional packages, e.g. chirp.service.providers package
   Use semi-colon to list additional packages.
   
4. Create new package, e.g. chirp.service.providers

5. Let's add new exception mapper class, e.g. DuplicateEntityExceptionMapper that
   extends base ExceptionMapper<DuplicateEntityException> class.
   
   Override toResponse() method to return a proper method with status FORBIDDEN (403).
   
6. Make sure your test passes.
