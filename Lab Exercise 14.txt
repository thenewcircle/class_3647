Lab Exercise 14
---------------

1. Our test application should have worked without need for links and HATEOAS.
   However, often times - our application relies on links to define state machine rules.

   Let's implement HATEOAS in our Chirp application.

   First we will start with structural links. Next lab we will add transitional links as well.

2. Let's add new URI field to representation classes, e.g. private URI self

   Use UriBuilder and Response classes to build self links.

   Do this for all representation classes, e.g.
      UserRepresentation
      PostRepresentation
      UserCollectionRepresentation
      PostCollectionRepresentation


      e.g. 
      
		URI selflink = UriBuilder
				.fromResource(this.getClass())
				.path(username)
				.build();
