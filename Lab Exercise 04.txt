Lab Exercise 4
--------------

1. What is Chirp?

2. Entities or Resources?

3. Services:

      User
        - Create a user
        - Retrieve a user
        - Retrieve all users
        - Delete a user

      Message
        - A user creates a message
        - Retrieve a message
        - Retrieve all messages for user
        - Delete a message
        
4. Map out the HTTP verbs for the services described above.

5. Think about the test cases for each.
   How will you verify if a service behaves as expected?
   
6. Next, we want to create a user first, before adding any messages for the user.

7. Create a test case first, e.g. UserResourceTest
   to submit a form data of a user with realname and username parameters.
   
8. Create a new user resource, e.g. UserResource and map it to
   http://localhost:8080/user
   
9. Use POST to create a new user, and use UserRepository to store it locally.
   Make sure you use x-www-form-urlencoded, not form-data.
