Lab Exercise 10
---------------

1. Now, we just have two resources:

     UserResource
     HelloResource
     
     Let's add another resource, e.g. PostResource that represents user's posted messages.

2. We want to create messages for a specific user, e.g. 

   /posts/{username}
 
   Add Path to the class.  
        
3. Let's implement create post message use case.

   Add new method to PostResource that will create Post for a specific user.
   

4. Return back CREATED with the URI of the created resource.
