--------------

1. We want to change the URL path from "hello" to "greeting", e.g.
   http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=NewCircle

2. Update the test case first.

3. Update the HelloResource to provide custom greeting using the name parameter.

4. Test that the solution works.

5. Questions:
* What type of parameter is "name"?
* How does one add support for this type of parameter?
* Where did you find information on how to update the code?
* How did you test the HelloResource for this new feature?
